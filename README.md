# Mapping_Earthquakes

## CHALLENGE OVERVIEW
---
This project goal is to create a map to see the earthquake data in relation to the tectonic platesâ€™ location on the earth, and they would like to see all the earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5 on the map, and they would like to see the data on a third map.
